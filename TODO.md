# Todo List

The following needs to be done, in the order in which they're presented:

## Project Development

Develop new or existing features, as well as correcting any bugs in
existing features, per the stakeholders' requests.

## Digression: `TODO`s, `FIXME`s and Docstrings

There are numerous `TODO`s and, more importantly, `FIXME`s littered
throughout the codebase. These are of varying priority and difficulty,
but ultimately should all be addressed. Any show-stopping `FIXME`s ought
to take immediate priority, but otherwise, the development of the
project's features is more important. As such, these notes largely serve
as digressions to break up the work.

Similarly, there are a lot of functions and methods with incomplete or
incorrect documentation. These are mostly listed as `TODO`s, but are
also important to complete for future maintenance efforts.
